/**
 * @module
 * @description
 * This module is used for handling user input, by defining and building a {@link ControlGroup} that
 * consists of
 * {@link Control} objects, and mapping them onto the DOM. {@link Control} objects can then be used
 * to read information
 * from the form DOM elements.
 *
 * This module is not included in the `angular2` module; you must import the forms module
 * explicitly.
